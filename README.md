🌍 Global Economy Analysis Dashboard

📌 Overview

This project analyzes the World 2023 dataset and provides insights into global economic and social indicators such as GDP, CPI, Life Expectancy, Population, and Employment.
The project was built in 3 phases over 3 weeks to ensure structured analysis and clear visualization.


📅 Week 1 – Data Understanding & Cleaning

Explored dataset columns (GDP, CPI, Population, Life Expectancy, Labor Force Participation, Birth Rate, etc.).

Identified measures for analysis: Total GDP, Average Life Expectancy, Employment Rate, CPI impact, Wealth Categories.

Created calculated fields (e.g., Employment Rate from Population × Labor Force Participation).

Classified countries by:

Developed Status

Wealth Category

Strong Economy & Health



📅 Week 2 – Business Questions

Defined 15 key analytical questions, for example:

1. Which countries contribute most to global GDP?


2. How does GDP correlate with CPI?


3. What is the relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita?


4. Which countries have the highest and lowest employment rates?


5. How do developed vs developing countries differ in economic performance?


6. Regional wealth distribution across continents.


7. Global GDP ranking and contribution rates.
... (and more, grouped into themes of Economy, Population, and Social Factors).



📅 Week 3 – Dashboard Design & Visualization

Built a 6-chart Power BI dashboard answering the above questions, including:

KPI Cards (Total GDP, Global GDP Contribution, Avg Life Expectancy, Employment Rate).

Treemap for GDP distribution by wealth category.

Scatter Plot (GDP vs CPI with life expectancy as size).

Stacked Bar (Employment by developed vs developing countries).

World Map with drill-through to country-level analysis.

Heatmap / Alternatives to Map showing regional performance.


Additional features:

Drill-through to country details (GDP, CPI, Population, Life Expectancy).

Icons added for intuitive design (💰 Economy, 🏥 Health, 👥 Population).

Balanced layout: KPIs on top, advanced visuals in the middle, map/heatmap at bottom.

🚀 Key Insights

GDP concentration is highly unequal across countries.

Higher CPI often correlates with weaker GDP stability.

Strong economies tend to have higher life expectancy.

Employment rates vary significantly by development status.

Population size does not always mean stronger GDP contribution.


🛠 Tools Used

Excel (Data exploration & calculated fields).

Power BI (Dashboard & visualizations).
